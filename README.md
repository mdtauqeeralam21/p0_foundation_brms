This is my P0 capstone project called Bus Reservation Management System.This is a Java project with Maven where I have used Java, mysql database, JDBC, Logger, Maven with Junit testing. This is the Bus Module which is only accessible to admin.There are 4 usecases in this project for the admin. The admin can add buses to be available for booking, list the added buses, delete a bus and also update the details of a bus. It is connected with the database using JDBC.It can also show the seat status of a particular bus.Using seat number the admin can see whether it is available or booked.I have added Logger and and also added some unit testing using Junit.
